# 🌌 Spectral Complexity Theory

Welcome to the official repository of **Spectral Complexity Theory (SCT)** — a new mathematical and computational framework for understanding the geometry of problem complexity, solvability, and hardness.

This repository includes (For Now):

- 📘 Preprints and research on SAT, Fourier-Walsh analysis, and spectral landscapes

---

## 🧠 About the Theory

Spectral Complexity Theory aims to reimagine the way we measure and visualize complexity. Instead of treating Boolean satisfiability (SAT) as purely symbolic, we convert logical formulas into **spectral signals** and project them into continuous geometries.

The approach draws from:

- 🧮 **Fourier and Walsh-Hadamard transforms**  
- 📊 **Spectral metrics** like entropy, energy, and variance  
- 🗺️ **UMAP projections** to map solvable vs unsolvable regions  
- 📐 A **manifold-based representation** of complexity classes

> _"What if we could see the hardness of a problem — before solving it?"_

## 📜 Papers

- **[Spectral Geometry of Boolean Satisfiability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392202309)**  
  _Explores the SAT problem through Fourier-Walsh analysis and spectral manifolds._  
  **Status:** Preprint (to appear on arXiv after endorsement)

Upcoming papers will generalize the approach to:

- 2-SAT and 4-SAT spectral maps
