## Summary

This paper introduces a novel spectral-topological framework for analyzing Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. By applying Fourier and Walshâ€“Hadamard transforms to logical formulas, it extracts spectral signatures that reveal the internal complexity structure of SAT instances.

Key contributions include:
- Continuous transformation of SAT formulas to \([-1,1]^n\) using Fourier-Walsh.
- Extraction of spectral features (entropy, energy, variance).
- Projection using UMAP to visualize separability between SAT and UNSAT instances.
- Introduction of the concept of a **complexity manifold**, a continuous space encoding problem hardness.
