## Summary

Building on the foundation laid in Paper 1, this work extends the spectral analysis across multiple levels of k-SAT (2-SAT, 3-SAT, 4-SAT). It tests the **continuity and geometric separability** of these instances within the proposed complexity manifold.

Key contributions include:
- Dynamic spectral feature extraction across varying clause counts.
- Cross-instance UMAP projection for geometric analysis of separability.
- Introduction of spectral deformation and match metrics to evaluate continuity.
- Empirical evidence supporting the existence of a learnable geometric space of SAT complexity.
